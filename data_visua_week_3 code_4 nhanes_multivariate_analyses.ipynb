    "We conclude this section by noting that marital status is associated with many factors, including gender and eduational status, but also varies strongly by age and birth cohort.  For example, it is unlikely for young people to be widowed, and it is less likely for older people to be \"never married\", since a person can transition from \"never married\" into one of the other categories, but can never move back.  Below we will consider the role of age in more detail, and later in the course we will revisit these questions using more sophisticated analytic methods that can account for all of these factors simultaneously.  However, since NHANES is a cross-sectional study, there are certain important questions that it cannot be used to answer.  For example, while we know each person's current marital status, we do not know their full marital history (e.g. how many times and at what ages they were married or divorced)."
